% The  code to compute the HRmax max heart rate:
%Below is my analysis  for my  approach:
%
%1. As the data is noisy, I first estimate a polynomial fit (or any other better fitting method)  to the data, in this case the effect of the noise of recording 
% is reduced (The blue lines).
%
%2. Also, the heart rate signal is not stationary so  the heart rate variability is changing during the time. So,  I estimated the short term variance of hr signals for short intervals (npadd variable  , defualt =  100,  still to  play with).
%
% In this case, if there are a lot of variation on the signal in a short time, I ignore those segments with high short time variance 
%  when computing the hrMax.
%
%3. I  computed the  polynomial fitted values  + 3*  short time standard deviation  for 2* npad time samples around each time sample  
%I have plotted this in magenta color.
%
%4. Max of the plot in  magenta color is the estimated hrMax if the variance  smaller than a threshold (here Th =5 ),
% The place of the estimation for hrMAx is shown by a black circle.
%
%The value of the maxHR estimation is shown in the command window after running the function.
% For each runner the estimate of the maxHR can be the average of all estimations.
%
%If I had more time:
%1 would try to remove outliers using more domain knowledge.
% I will denoise the hrSignals more  using digital filtering
%
%I will search more on the internet for efficient hr variability measuring from the data.  
%I will play more with the parameters I introduced to find  the best estimate of the maxHR

% Estimating the maximum heart rate
% (MAX_HR) of a runner based on his measured heart rate (HR) during a
% single run. Note that during a run, a runnerâ€™s HR will likely not reach
% its maximum value. A runner might be running at 140 during a run but
% his maximum heart rate might be much higher. The idea is to estimate heart rate
% variability (HRV) during the run and based on this measure, estimate MAX_HR.
